# Jenkins

Automated build for a Jenkins image including plugins and seed job.

To trigger a new build, create a tag (<jenkinsVersion>-<iteration>, e.g. 2.60.1-3 for our 3rd try with Jenkins 2.60.1).

This project is inspired by Torben Knerr's [jenkins-pipes-infra](https://github.com/tknerr/jenkins-pipes-infra), which provides a more extensive documentation.
